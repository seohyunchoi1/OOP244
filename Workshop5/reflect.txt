The work I've done for the OOP244 (C++ Programming) course at Seneca under the Computer Programming & Analysis (CPA) program

First of all, when I write a reflection on this workshop, I cannot leave out the story of stringstream, which made the biggest difference from part 1 of this workshop. stringstream is useful when extracting the necessary information from a given string. More details can be found in the sstream library window on Microsoft's official website.

In fact, this workshop was able to finish fairly quickly. However, during the workshop part 2, I went back to my homeland, Korea, and got an additional two days extended by the professor. The two days were enough time to study the function of the sstream, and I was able to carry out this workshop without much difficulty by adding a little code in part 1.

The most difficult part was operator overloading. But I think operator overloading is one of the cool features of C++, given that special meaning can be given to operators when using user-defined classes. Of course, it was difficult when I first studied, but after seeing it a few times, I could easily understand it.
